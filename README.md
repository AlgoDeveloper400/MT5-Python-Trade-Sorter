# MT5-Python-Trade-Sorter
This Python code takes the MQL5 tester report and extracts trade data from the deals table.
It uses the MQL5 tester report(saved as xlsx format), and arranges the trades based on in direction and out direction then merges the data all in 1 line.
Instead of having 2 lines for in and out, this code simplifies everything so your trade data is sorted nicely and you can take the output pdf and use it for data analysis, machine learning or for whatever you wish.
